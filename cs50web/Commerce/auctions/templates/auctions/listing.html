<!-- Listing Page: Clicking on a listing should take users to 
 a page specific to that listing. On that page, users should 
 be able to view all details about the listing, including the 
 current price for the listing.

If the user is signed in, the user should be able to add the 
 item to their “Watchlist.” If the item is already on the watchlist, 
 the user should be able to remove it.

If the user is signed in, the user should be able to bid on the 
 item. The bid must be at least as large as the starting bid, and 
 must be greater than any other bids that have been placed (if any). 
 If the bid doesn’t meet those criteria, the user should be presented with an error.

If the user is signed in and is the one who created the listing, the user should 
have the ability to “close” the auction from this page, which makes the highest 
bidder the winner of the auction and makes the listing no longer active.
If a user is signed in on a closed listing page, and the user has won that 
auction, the page should say so.

Users who are signed in should be able to add comments to the listing page. 
The listing page should display all comments that have been made on the listing.-->
